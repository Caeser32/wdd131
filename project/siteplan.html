            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Siza Creations</strong></p>
            <p>
                I chose the name "Siza Creations" because it ties directly to my identity
                as an artist and animator. "Siza" comes from my surname, Msiza, and connects
                to my YouTube channel Caesar_Siza where I have been posting story time
                animations since 2016. The word "Creations" reflects the range of work I
                do — from animated storytelling to character design and graphic art. It is
                simple, personal, and broad enough to grow with me as my creative work evolves.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of Siza Creations is to serve as a professional portfolio
                showcasing my journey as a story time animator and character artist. The
                site will feature animated projects from my YouTube channel Caesar_Siza,
                including work like "Third wheel/candleholder" and "Anxiety," along with
                character designs, graphic design studies, and newer projects from after
                my mission. Visitors will be able to explore my work chronologically,
                watch embedded animations, view character art galleries, and understand
                how my style has developed over the years. The site gives me a dedicated
                space to present my creative work outside of YouTube in a way that I
                fully control.

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I saw one of your animations on YouTube and want to see more of your
                    work — where can I browse all of your animation projects in one place?
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am interested in your character design style — can I see examples
                    of your character art and learn about your creative process?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How has your animation and art style changed since you started in 2016?

            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>
                The color palette is designed to reflect a creative, bold animation
                portfolio. The dark background creates a cinematic feel that lets artwork
                stand out, while the vibrant orange and magenta accents bring energy and
                personality.
