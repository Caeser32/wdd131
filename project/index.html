                    <p>I'm Tumisang, but most people know me as Caesar_Siza online. I started making animations back in 2016, just messing around with story time videos on YouTube. What began as a hobby quickly became something I genuinely cared about. My early work was rough, but I loved the process of bringing characters and stories to life.</p>
                    <p>After my mission, I came back with a fresh perspective and even more motivation to improve. I'm currently studying software development at BYU-Pathway Worldwide, but animation and character design are still a huge part of who I am. Every project teaches me something new, and I'm always looking for the next story to tell.</p>
