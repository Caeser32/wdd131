              <p>
                My name is <strong>Tumisang Msiza</strong>. Family is central to how I approach life and learning.
                I have been married to my wife for almost two years — one of my greatest personal highlights. I am
                the oldest of three siblings and these responsibilities shaped my leadership and care for others.
              </p>

              <p>
                I served a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the COVID
                period,
                serving in the Zimbabwe Bulawayo Mission and later in the South Africa Cape Town Mission. These
                experiences
                influenced my approach to service, learning, and personal development.

          <div class="project-text">
            <p>
              I enjoy creative activities such as drawing and design. I previously studied graphic design and
              animation, and I continue to appreciate visual storytelling and creative expression. Earlier in
              my life, I also explored animation projects through a YouTube channel, which helped me develop
              patience, creativity, and attention to detail.
            </p>

            <p>
              I enjoy staying active and have participated in sports such as rugby and tennis. I also value
              communication and self-expression, having taken part in debates, poetry, and public speaking
              during my school years. These experiences have strengthened my confidence and ability to
              communicate ideas clearly.
